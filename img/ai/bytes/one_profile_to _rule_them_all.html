<p>Year 2026 – humanity is connected to a network that controls us and our everyday decisions through a world of annoying ads, products, a subtle invasion of trolls, bots, and generated content.</p>

<h2 id="social-networks-centralized-services-and-artificial-bonds-of-the-metaverse">Social networks, centralized services, and artificial bonds of the METAverse</h2>

<p>After the turn of the millennium, <strong>GEN Z</strong> moves from physical reality into online spaces - <strong>Metaverses</strong>. Within online network spaces, which over time transform from social networks into a vast projection resembling the American dream of Times Square.</p>

<p>Through continuous scrolling, we dive deeper into the world of friends, friends of our friends, and enemies, online <em>marketplaces</em>, and algorithmic advertisements. There is no longer any need to use <strong>Google</strong> or <em>e-mail</em>. Everything we need can be found on<strong>Facebooku</strong> and we connect with everyone through chats.
<strong>Facebook</strong> transforms into <strong>Meta</strong>, which tightens its grip on <strong>Instagram</strong> and <strong>WhatsApp</strong> , mercilessly crushing its competition into the ground. Times have changed, and the saying <em>„The more languages you know, the more of a person you are.“</em> no longer holds true. Instead, a new one applies: <em>„The more profiles you have, the more of a person you are.“</em> </p>

<h3 id="migration-of-nations-generations">Migration of <del>Nations</del> GENerations</h3>

<p>The perception of platforms changes over time, and with it the user groups themselves. <strong>Facebook</strong>, once a space for the young, begins to be populated by their fathers, mothers, uncles, aunts, and now even grandfathers and grandmothers. <strong>The migration of generations begins!</strong></p>

<p>We migrate to <strong>Instagram</strong>, where we upload stunning photos with plenty of filters. Radical opinions are posted on the bird platform <del><strong>Twitter</strong></del> (<em>X</em>), intimate photos are sent via <strong>Snapchat</strong>, and endless loops of a few-second videos are posted on the Chinese platform <strong>TikTok</strong>. We colonize these digital territories — each with a different purpose.</p>

<p>However, even these new platforms gradually become infiltrated by <em>Boomers</em>. We are forced to create a new network, by <strong>GEN Z</strong> for <strong>GEN Z</strong>. And so <strong>BeReal</strong> is born! We have a great time — until a higher power of Capitalism enters the game. <strong>Voodoo</strong> - a company creating nonsensical A.I. games with endless gameplay and high addictiveness — offers the founders <strong>€500 million</strong>. And as with tempting offers, this one simply cannot be refused.</p>

<h3 id="the-musks-sugarbergs-thiels-and-other-digital-curators-dictators-of-silicon-valley">The Musks, Sugarbergs, Thiels, and other digital curators (“dictators”) of Silicon Valley</h3>

<p>The physical world has its rulers — monarchs, presidents, and unfortunately dictators as well. The virtual world has its rulers too; however, these rulers are not chosen by the free will of the people nor by bloodline. Their power is determined by capital, which allows them to create a new world trading in information — and to subsequently transform that information back into even greater profit.</p>

<h4 id="paypal-mafia">PayPal Mafia</h4>

<p>One might think that theorizing about the Internet and its interconnected relationships is already far-fetched enough that it couldn’t possibly go any further — and yet, I will now try to take it even further.</p>

<p>We now arrive at some of the most influential people from Silicon Valley, informally known as the <strong>PayPal Mafia</strong>. This is a group of investors and entrepreneurs who were involved in the creation of <strong>PayPal</strong> and who, in the 1990s, helped one another and invested in each other’s projects. </p>

<p>The most well-known members of this “group” are:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Elon Musk</strong> (co-founder of <a class="autolink" href="https://x.com">x.com</a> (which merged with <strong>PayPal</strong>), Tesla, SpaxeX, current owner of <del><strong>Twitteru</strong></del> now <strong>X</strong>)</li>
<li><strong>Peter Thiel</strong> (co-founder of <strong>Paypal</strong>, first investor in <strong>Facebooku</strong>, co-founder of <strong>Palantir</strong>)</li>
<li>Reid Hoffman(<strong>LinkedIn</strong>)</li>
<li>Chad Hurley, Steve Chen, Jawed Karim (<strong>YouTube</strong>)</li>
<li>... <sup><a href="#fn2-13342" id="fnr2-13342" title="see footnote" class="footnote">2</a></sup></li>
</ul>

<p>After these people sold <strong>PayPal</strong> to <strong>eBay</strong> and earned <strong>$1.5 billion</strong> from the transaction, they began investing in other major technology companies and startups. Today, these investments shape events around the world — not only in the field of technological development and digital worlds, but also in politics, military conflicts, and the global economic system. <sup><a href="#fn3-13342" id="fnr3-13342" title="see footnote" class="footnote">3</a></sup></p>

<h5 id="books-on-the-topic">Books on the Topic</h5>

<p>Many interesting books have been written on the subject of the PayPal Mafia. Particularly noteworthy is <strong>The PayPal Mafia</strong> by one of its former members, <em>Eric M. Jackson</em>. This book describes events “from the inside,” based on personal experience. <sup><a href="#fn4-13342" id="fnr4-13342" title="see footnote" class="footnote">4</a></sup></p>

<p>Another significant publication is <strong>The Founders: Elon Musk, Peter Thiel and the Company that Made the Modern Internet</strong> by author Jimmy Soni, which describes the creation of the company and interweaves the stories of the individual founders and their destinies. <sup><a href="#fn5-13342" id="fnr5-13342" title="see footnote" class="footnote">5</a></sup></p>

<h3 id="technogiganti-a-jejich-vizecile">Technogiganti a jejich vize/cíle</h3>

<p>It is also necessary to consider the aspects of the visions and goals of individual technological actors. Each of these technogigants has its own ideas about the future and objectives that are reflected not only in the platforms themselves, but also in their technological foundations.</p>

<p>As users, we do not know exactly what happens to the data we provide to these services. One thing is certain, however — the trade in data is their fundamental pillar. As <em>Janis Varoufakis</em> states in his book <strong>Technofeudalism</strong>, modern technology is constantly “listening in” on us, whether through voice assistants, mobile devices, or social networks themselves. Based on what we watch, what we pay attention to, and what behavioral patterns we exhibit, targeted advertisements are then served to us. In the extreme case, which Varoufakis also mentions, algorithms are no longer merely reacting to our habits, but actively shaping and transforming them. <sup><a href="#fn6-13342" id="fnr6-13342" title="see footnote" class="footnote">6</a></sup></p>

<p>Through these data trades, we thus indirectly finance large capitalist corporations, which then reinvest their profits, among other things, into the arms industry — thereby contributing to the support of military conflicts. In this context, one can mention, for example, the music platform <strong>Spotify</strong>, whose CEO <strong>Daniel Ek</strong> invested in the company <strong>Helsing</strong>, which specializes in the development of military drones. <sup><a href="#fn7-13342" id="fnr7-13342" title="see footnote" class="footnote">7</a></sup></p>

<p>We could find an entire range of such questionable moves throughout the technology industry. At the same time, however, we can also observe the emergence of a certain cult of technogigants, who strive to create the <strong>Metaverse</strong>, r develop artificial intelligence, celebrate the arrival of a “new Christ,” fear the <strong>Antichrist</strong> in the form of <em>Greta Thunberg</em> or attempt to find a cure for immortality.</p>

<h3 id="in-the-grip-of-the-dead-internet">In the Grip of the Dead Internet</h3>

<p>On November 30, 2022, the first reports appear about the public launch of the artificial intelligence <strong>ChatGPT</strong>. A revolution begins. Times are changing! Companies around the world start integrating AI-based tools into their processes and optimizing work through algorithmic “tricks.”</p>

<p>Social platforms immediately seize this opportunity and launch their own <em>chatboty</em> such as <strong>X</strong> introducing its assistant <strong>Grok</strong>. Users begin widely using text and image generators. Suddenly, the whole world starts worrying that artificial intelligence will replace humans — in jobs, in art, and in existence itself! But is this really true???</p>

<p><strong>AI SLOP is here!</strong></p>
<div class="page-break" style="page-break-before: always;"></div>

<p>A year before the global AI <strong>BOOM</strong> u , a discussion appears on <strong>Reddit</strong> titled <strong>&quot;Dead Internet Theory: Most Of The Internet Is Fake“</strong>. It explores the assumption that more than half of the Internet is no longer inhabited by humans, but by artificial activity – <strong>bots</strong> and <strong>artificially generated content</strong> (<em>content</em>) manipulated by <em>algorithmic curators</em>. <sup><a href="#fn9-13342" id="fnr9-13342" title="see footnote" class="footnote">9</a></sup> </p>

<h2 id="escape-from-the-matrix">Escape from the Matrix</h2>

<p>And what about us now? <strong>GEN Z!</strong> It’s time to move forward. To explore unknown territories and seek places not watched by the “<em>Eye of Sauron</em>“ where we can find <em>Paradise</em>. To leave platforms generating profits for insane philanthropists and filled with lifeless entities. To reclaim our data. To delete our profiles.</p>

<p>There is hope! The path lies in abandoning <strong>Web 2</strong> and moving to <strong>Web 3</strong>. To decentralize. To find community spaces created by users for users — regardless of profit. To leave behind <em>hate culture</em> and seek mutual understanding. To live a life without algorithms and discover new ways of connecting.</p>
